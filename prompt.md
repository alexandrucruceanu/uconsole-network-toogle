I have a uconsole with the raspberry pi 4 module and a 4g lte module from clockwork. I am running kali linux and I want to set up  the mobile connectivity. The sim is from digi spain and it is inserted in its slot. The digi spain apn is this one: internet.digimobil.es 
Give me a script that i can save as a program and run it when i want to connect to the mobile network. Give me a window with a toggle button between wifi and mobile connectivity. 

This is the official info from the uconsole github repo.
